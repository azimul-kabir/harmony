# Harmony Library Architecture

> Version: 1.8.0
> Status: Implemented Foundation
> Last Updated: 2026-07-21

---

# Overview

The Library Engine is the core of Harmony.

Harmony is **not a music player**.

Harmony's responsibility is to:

- Acquire music
- Organize music
- Maintain metadata
- Keep the library healthy
- Expose the library through APIs

Playback is delegated to applications like Navidrome.

---

# Design Principles

The Library must be:

- Fast
- Reliable
- Incremental
- Extensible
- Source-independent

Never depend on one metadata provider or one download source.

Future integrations include:

- MusicBrainz
- Cover Art Archive
- YouTube Music
- Deezer
- Discogs
- Navidrome

# Library Index

The Library Index is the source of truth.

The persistent index is the `songs` table. One row represents one managed
audio file and keeps a stable internal ID even when the file becomes missing.
Downloaded files must be indexed through `LibraryService`; download workers,
API routes, and future integrations must not maintain parallel song records.

In addition to descriptive metadata, each indexed file stores technical audio
properties, artwork status, availability, filesystem timestamps, metadata hash,
download source, Spotify/MusicBrainz/ISRC identifiers, and indexing timestamps.
Playlist sources are resolved from the persistent `playlists` and
`playlist_tracks` index using the Spotify track ID. This avoids duplicating
playlist membership on each song row while still exposing it in Library APIs.

Incremental indexing compares file size and modified time before parsing tags.
Unchanged files are skipped. Re-indexing forces tag extraction and compares the
metadata hash. Files absent during reconciliation are marked `missing`, not
deleted, so history, source relationships, and internal IDs remain stable.

Library maintenance API:

- `GET /api/library/songs/{id}` returns one complete index record.
- `GET /api/library/missing` returns retained missing-file records.
- `POST /api/library/index` incrementally indexes one file.
- `POST /api/library/rescan` reconciles the managed library.
- `POST /api/library/reindex` forces a complete metadata rebuild.

Never scan the filesystem unless:

- First startup
- Manual rebuild
- Integrity verification

Normal operation should use incremental updates.

# File Watcher

`LibraryWatcher` runs as a supervised background service for the configured
music root. It uses native filesystem notifications through Watchdog and does
not perform periodic full-directory scans.

Supported changes:

- New audio files are incrementally indexed after a short debounce period.
- Deleted audio files are retained in the index and marked `missing`.
- Modified files are forcibly re-read so tag-only changes are detected even
  when file size or timestamp granularity would otherwise hide the change.
- Renamed and moved files update the existing row before re-indexing, preserving
  the stable internal song ID.

Filesystem tools often emit several notifications while a file is being
written. Events are coalesced per path and failed indexing operations are
retried with bounded backoff. A supervisor restarts the native observer if it
stops unexpectedly. Failures and recoveries use the standard Harmony logger.

The watcher publishes transient domain events through `LibraryEventBroker`:

- `library.track.added`
- `library.track.updated`
- `library.track.missing`
- `library.track.renamed`
- `library.index.error`
- `library.watcher.error`
- `library.watcher.recovered`

Consumers can subscribe using `GET /api/library/events`, an SSE endpoint. These
events are notifications, not persistent state; reconnecting consumers must
query the Library Index to reconcile their view.

No full rescans are initiated by the watcher. Manual rescan and re-index
operations remain explicit integrity tools.

---

# Search

Search operates only on the Library Index.

Never search the filesystem.

Harmony's first indexed search engine uses SQLite FTS5. `library_search` is a
derived projection keyed by the stable Song ID; API results are always hydrated
from canonical `songs`, `playlists`, and `playlist_tracks` records. The search
projection contains no file paths and search execution performs no filesystem
access.

The FTS tokenizer is Unicode-aware, removes diacritics, and supports prefix
matching across multiple terms. Results are ordered by BM25 relevance, then by
stable Library metadata. Missing-file rows remain searchable only when the
caller explicitly enables `include_missing`.

The projection is maintained transactionally when a Song is indexed or
re-indexed. Playlist synchronization refreshes only Songs associated with the
changed playlist track IDs. The Alembic migration backfills existing libraries.
`POST /api/library/search/rebuild` is an explicit repair operation; normal
search and watcher activity never initiate a filesystem scan or full rebuild.

Supported search fields

Title

Artist

Album

Genre

Playlist

Spotify ID

MusicBrainz ID

Filename

Search API:

- `GET /api/library/search?q=...` returns ranked, paginated Song records.
- Optional filters: artist, album, genre, playlist_id, year, min_bitrate,
  max_bitrate, and include_missing.
- `POST /api/library/search/rebuild` rebuilds the projection from database
  records only.

The web Library search box queries this API with a debounce and projects the
ranked Song matches into the Songs, Albums, and Artists views. Collection names
remain locally filtered UI navigation rather than FTS content.

## Sorting and Filtering

Library listing and FTS search share the immutable `LibraryFilters` query model.
All supplied filters use AND semantics and execute against indexed database
columns; the UI never filters by reading tags or walking the filesystem.

Supported sorts are Artist, Album, Title, Recently Added, Recently Modified,
Bitrate, Duration, Year, and Alphabetical. Sort keys are allow-listed and use
stable secondary ordering. Supported filters are Artist, Album, Genre, Codec,
Bitrate range, Downloaded Today, Recently Added, Missing Artwork, and Missing
Metadata. Search additionally retains the Playlist, Year, and missing-file
filters exposed by the first FTS API.

`GET /api/library/filter-options` returns the distinct metadata values and
standard bitrate bands used to build filter controls. `GET /api/library/songs`
and `GET /api/library/search` accept the same composable filter parameters.
Downloaded Today uses `songs.created_at` since that is the Library Index's date
added; Recently Added is the rolling seven-day window used elsewhere.

Sort and filter preferences are stored in browser local storage under a
versioned Harmony key. Preferences are presentation state, not shared Library
domain data, and therefore do not require a database table or migration.

Single-column and selective composite indexes cover availability, artist,
album, title, genre, codec, bitrate, year, date added, and last modified. This
keeps common filter/sort plans efficient without duplicating canonical Song
metadata.

# Artwork

Artwork is a reusable, content-addressed resource. The `artwork` table owns one
row per unique image and Songs reference it through nullable `songs.artwork_id`.
The checksum is a SHA-256 digest of the image bytes and is unique, so identical
embedded or folder images share one database row and one cached file.

Cached files live below the configured `ARTWORK_CACHE_PATH` in checksum-prefix
directories. Cache paths are internal implementation details and are never
returned to API clients. The public immutable URL is
`/api/artwork/{id}/file`. Cache writes are atomic; a database record whose file
was lost is repaired from the next locally detected copy.

Artwork resolution runs as part of Library indexing and uses this priority:

1 Embedded artwork

2 Existing associated cache

3 Folder artwork

4 Future providers (not fetched by the foundation)

- Spotify

- Cover Art Archive

Supported folder filenames are `cover`, `folder`, `front`, and `album` with
JPEG, PNG, or WebP extensions. Embedded images are read through Mutagen from
ID3 APIC, MP4 `covr`, and FLAC picture blocks. Remote `cover_url` values remain
compatible metadata but are never downloaded by `ArtworkService`.

Artwork API:

- `GET /api/artwork` lists resource metadata with offset/limit pagination.
- `GET /api/artwork/{id}` returns one resource's metadata and public URL.
- `GET /api/artwork/{id}/file` serves immutable cached bytes.

The model reserves `provider`, `provider_id`, and `original_url` for future
Spotify and Cover Art Archive provenance. Manual replacement will create or
reuse a content-addressed resource and change an association; it must never
overwrite shared bytes in place. Remote-provider ingestion and manual upload
endpoints are intentionally outside this foundation.

# Metadata

Harmony owns metadata.

Future metadata providers

Spotify

MusicBrainz

Discogs

Embedded tags

Manual edits

Every field should include:

# Smart Collections

Collections are generated.

Users never manually edit them.

The Library API currently exposes foundation collections at
`GET /api/library/collections`. Counts are calculated exclusively from
available records in the Library Index. The Library web page presents Songs,
Albums, Artists, and Collections as separate views; none of these views scan or
query the filesystem. Selecting a generated collection filters the indexed
Songs projection.

The initial generated collections are Recently Added (seven days), High
Bitrate (320 kbps or higher), Missing Artwork, and Missing Metadata. These are
query-backed views and do not introduce duplicated collection state.
