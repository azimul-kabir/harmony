# Harmony Library Architecture

> Version: 1.5.0
> Status: Draft
> Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD

---

# Overview

The Library Engine is the core of Harmony.

Harmony is **not a music player**.

Harmony's responsibility is to:

- Acquire music
- Organize music
- Maintain metadata
- Keep the library healthy
- Expose the library through APIs

Playback is delegated to applications like Navidrome.

---

# Design Principles

The Library must be:

- Fast
- Reliable
- Incremental
- Extensible
- Source-independent

Never depend on one metadata provider or one download source.

Future integrations include:

- MusicBrainz
- Cover Art Archive
- YouTube Music
- Deezer
- Discogs
- Navidrome

- duration
- bitrate
- codec
- sample_rate
- file_size
- path

## Playlist

Represents where a song came from.

Fields

- id
- spotify_playlist_id
- name
- owner
- source

A song may belong to multiple playlists.

---

## Collection

Generated automatically.

Examples

Recently Added

Highest Bitrate

Missing Artwork

Duplicate Songs

Favorites

---

# Services

The Library Engine is composed of independent services.

```
LibraryService

MetadataService

ArtworkService

SearchService

CollectionService

AnalyticsService

IndexService

WatcherService

ImportService
```

Each service should have a single responsibility.

---

# Event Flow

Downloads should never update the UI directly.

Everything passes through the Library.

```

# Library Index

The Library Index is the source of truth.

Never scan the filesystem unless:

- First startup
- Manual rebuild
- Integrity verification

Normal operation should use incremental updates.

---

# File Watcher

The watcher monitors:

New files

Deleted files

Modified files

Renamed files

The watcher updates the Library Index.

No full rescans.

---

# Search

Search operates only on the Library Index.

Never search the filesystem.

Supported search fields

Title

Artist

Album

Genre

Playlist

Spotify ID

MusicBrainz ID

ISRC

Filename

---

# Artwork

Artwork priority

1 Embedded artwork

2 Cached artwork

3 Folder artwork

4 Future providers

- Spotify

- Cover Art Archive

---

# Metadata

Harmony owns metadata.

Future metadata providers

Spotify

MusicBrainz

Discogs

Embedded tags

Manual edits

Every field should include:

Value

Provider

Confidence

Last Updated

---

# Smart Collections

Collections are generated.

Users never manually edit them.

Examples

Recently Added

Recently Downloaded

Missing Metadata

Missing Artwork

High Bitrate

Large Albums

Future

Custom Rules

---

# Analytics

Analytics use the Library Index.

Never calculate directly from the filesystem.

Examples

Song Count

Album Count

Artist Count

Genre Count

Storage

Average Bitrate

Health Score

---

# Duplicate Detection (Future)

Audio Fingerprint

Duplicate handling is a separate service.

# Multi-Source Downloads (Future)

Harmony separates metadata from audio.

# Media Server Integration (Future)

Harmony manages the library.

Media servers consume it.

Harmony never becomes a streaming server.

Supported servers

Navidrome

Jellyfin

Subsonic-compatible

---

# Database Design

The database should be normalized.

Recommended tables

artists

albums

songs

artwork

playlists

playlist_songs

collections

collection_items

library_events

download_sources

metadata_sources

Future tables

duplicates

metadata_history

play_history

---

# Performance Goals

Library startup:

<5 seconds

Incremental indexing:

<100ms per file

Search:

<50ms

Artwork retrieval:

Instant

Support

100,000+ songs

10,000+ albums

5,000+ artists

---

# Coding Standards

Every new feature should:

Use LibraryService.

Never duplicate metadata parsing.

Never access the filesystem from UI routes.

Use dependency injection.

Keep services independent.

Write unit tests.

Update this document if architecture changes.

---

# Long-Term Vision

Harmony is a **self-hosted music acquisition and library management platform**.

Responsibilities

✓ Download music

✓ Organize music

✓ Maintain metadata

✓ Repair libraries

✓ Manage artwork

✓ Detect duplicates

✓ Generate collections

✓ Expose APIs

✗ Stream music

✗ Play music

Harmony prepares the perfect music library.

Applications like Navidrome provide playback.
